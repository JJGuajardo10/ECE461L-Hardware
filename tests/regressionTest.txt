We don't really have a formalized system for regression testing, so instead we just run through the steps to 
ensure that the system's prior functionality is effective.

Regression Test Steps:
--- Existing elements in database test ---
1. Click Login Page after project loads up. Login with the existing userid combination "SteveJobs" and "Apple" for password
2. Enter project tab, and join project with id "1234". This project should be the "MacBookPro" project
3. Enter hardware tab to view that current project is id: 1234

--- Add new elements to database test ---
1. Create new user with a new userid and pswd combination
2. Login with said new user
3. Enter Projects and create a new project using a unique project id and whatever project details you are interested in
4. Join this newly created project
5. Enter the hardware tab and view the details of the newly created project
