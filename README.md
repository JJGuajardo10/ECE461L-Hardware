Steps for Installing Dependancies
1. npm install to download all needed node modules

2. create a virtual environment to run the server code (ex. python -m venv env)

3. Enter the virtual environment and install the modules required for running the server code (just run python app.py or python3 app.py and pip install <package> for every package the system asks for you to install)

That's it for the installation of dependancies!

Steps to run Project:
1. Have two terminal windows open 
2. In one terminal, run "npm start", which will start the client 
3. In the other terminal, enter your virtual environment and run 'python app.py" or "python3 app.py"
